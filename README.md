# Guess Billboard Hot 100 ?
SINCE the social network has taken up the center stage in every aspect of our life, the indicator of the popularity in the entertainment business has been shifted. Especially in the music scene, the record sales or the frequent exposure to the major media yields their limelight to the new medium, the social network and youtube. The number of followers of the social network and the subscribers of youtube can be the reliable proof for the popularity of the pop artists? How can these numbers be related with the commercial success of the song? This project started from these questions.

Featuring is the particular type of creative collaboration involving one artist integrating another artist’s contribution, either instrumentally or vocally, into their work and publicizing it with a "featuring" credit. It has become the key element to the music fan ‘who feat. whom’ and played a significant role in the marketing and publicity for the song even before the release.

“Guess Billboard Hot 100?” is an interactive platform to choose two artists, “who ‘FEAT.’ whom” and provide the expected rank on Billboard Hot 100 Chart based on machine learning technology.

What we want to examine with this platform is the plausibility of an artist's popularity on Social networks for the song’s success on the chart rather than the music’s quality itself.
